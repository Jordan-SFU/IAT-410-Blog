      <p><em>First Playable & Modular Components</em></p>

      <p>
        This week, I continued working on integrating the art assets into the game, as well as assisting the programmers with the first playable prototype.
        With one of the programmers working on the asteroid spawning system, and the other implementing player movement, I focused on
        bringing it all together into a unified loop, complete with art assets and basic UI.

        To help speed up the designing process and decouple it from the implementation, I created a tile system in Unity to allow the designer to easily lay out the ship environment, as well as decide which sequence of tools is required 
        to fix a given ship component. Its as easy as clicking the + button, and selecting the desired tool from the dropdown menu. You can also
        specify how much damage the ship takes when a panel of this type is destroyed, which is also how much health the ship regains upon its successful
        repair.

        In addition, I created another modular system to control how we will define levels in our game. Using Unity's custom editor feature, I created
        a timeline view, allowing our designers to control the various events in our game such as asteroid and alien spawning. They can choose
        between wave spawning (all at once) or continuous spawning over a given period, and these can be overlapped to create engaging and dynamic
        levels. It's also easily extensible for when we add new environment hazards allowning our designers to work independantly of our programmers
        to ensure a streamlined process.

        I also added shell menus, player + ship health, the repairing system with minigames, indicators for off-screen hazards
        and tools, as well as additional tool effects such as the fire extinguisher propelling the player and putting out fire, and the metal sheet 
        reducing damage done to the player.

        Some problems I identified earlier are starting to surface, but regardless I remain optimistic. I've been helping out on the programming side
        to speed up the development of the first playable, which has left me little time to further refine the assets. I'll have to remain in constant 
        communication with our project manager to ensure I can fulfill my responsibilities as the artist, while also providing necessary contributions
        to the programming. I'll admit, it was nice to take a break from the art to dive into implementation as it's certainly my stronger skill, but as 
        deadlines approach, I'll likely have to pivot back to solely focus on the assets if we ever plan to catch up to our timeline. 

        Next on the list is to refactor this prototype code into something more extensible, and to make it easier for our other programmers to continue
        development. We'd also like to have the shop and upgrade system done within the next two weeks. I'll also be responsible for finishing off
        some additional assets as we need them, such as additional asteroid types, aliens, miscellaneous hazards, as well as the UI. We've also got a backlog
        of things we'd like to change from the playtesting sessions we held, which will be gradually implemented during the refactor process.
